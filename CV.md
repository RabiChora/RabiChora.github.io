## <u>Coding Experience</u>
### <u>Unity(C#)</u>
* Participated in a lot of Projects, has experience in designing and optimizing games, in particular, implementing rim light occlusion on mobile devices without turning on shadows
* Proficient in using ShaderLab and HLSL language to write shaders in Unity. (Images showing in [Works](https://rabichora.github.io/works/))
* Shader investigation in reproducing the [Toon shader in game Genshin Impact](https://github.com/RabiChora/GenshinLikeToonShading)
* Self developed [heart explosion VFX](https://github.com/RabiChora/Heart-Explosion-Effect) every piece made by myself

### <u>Python</u>
* Use The Least square method to implement linear regression.
* compare the Naïve Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression, for their speed and accuracy on two different datasets.
* Build a convolutional neural network to classify handwritten digits. More specifically, we will use the MNIST dataset to implement and
  evaluate a neural network-based model for classification of handwritten digits.
* Final Year Project on medical image segmentation(pytorch):
    * Implementing random plane localization in a 3D volume
    * Implementing a 2D U-Net with pytorch and 
    * Training image segmentation with the U-Net implemented
* **[Blender Tools](https://github.com/RabiChora/Blender-Auto-Tools)**: 
    * Automatically assign well named textures to a fixed material shader
    * Automatically import a whole set of pre-made Model representation scene with a user chosen model and
    * A well implemented tool to choose the color of the pre-made Model representation scene with correspoding shade color automatically chosen
    * Automatic rendering scene.
    * (A simple Photoshop tool to overlay rendered model picture with shadow onto the rendered background image)
    * Python scripts to re-formalize the file names.
    
### <u>School Mini Projects</u>
* #### <u>Haskell</u>
    * A small project of designing a high efficiency calculation algorithm of the nth Fibonacci number.
    * A medium project that draw Mazes in Haskell and design related algorithms to solve the maze (calculating a correct route)
    
* #### <u>Scala</u>
    * A program for encrypting files that uses a key string to turn a file of ordinary text into a file of seemingly incomprehensible gibberish. The program will also decode the gibberish to give the original file, provided we remember the key.
    * Implement a class using linked list to implement a mutable set. each object of which acts like a mutable set of integers.
    * Modifying a fairly substantial existing editor by adding in some extra commands. Including: i) Make the keystrokes Ctrl-Home and CtrlEnd move the cursor to the start and end of the editing buffer respectively; ii) Transpose character, Undo and redo the transposition; iii) Cut and copy commands; iv) simple search command.
    * A small program that given a letter chart, solving these problems: i) for a given table, find whether it is possible to bracket a word w to have result z; ii) find out how many bracketing method for a word w can have a result of z; iii) if there is a method to bracket word w and return a result z, then output the bracketing method.
    * Concurrent programming using scala:
        * Built a network to sort numerical arrays;
        * Solve the dinning philosopher problem by 3 ways;
        * Implement DFS by concurrent programming, and solve sudoku problems by the implemented DFS;
        * Use the monitor and semaphore to simulate the problem of : “a tutor waiting for students to come to classes, and will only start after 2 students were all in his room , and students can only leave after the tutor has finished the class.

## <u>Intern Experience</u>
### <u>Perfect World Co.,Ltd (June 2020 – June 2021)</u>
* Worked as a Technical Artist in the company and mainly developing in Unity 3D engine, along the line of Toon shading and Effect shading. Wrote many effect shader, participated in the making of technical demo and some game project in the company, implemented a PBR compress method on my own.

### <u> Tencent (July 2021 – now)</u>
* Worked as a Technical Artist in the company and mainly developing in Unity 3D engine, invested Screen Spaced SubSurface Scattering for unity, and using SH functions to implement rim light masking, delivered these investigations towards game projects in the company
